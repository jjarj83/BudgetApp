# Personal Finance Tracker App

This personal finance app will be used by me to track my spending, my account balances,
and my progress towards retirement. I wanted to create my own, so that I'd have more
control over the data. Online apps often do not allow for the user to adjust
spending categories or often double counts money when it is moving through accounts.
Since this app will have the info manually entered, which I weirdly prefer, these
issues will not occur. Many of the dashboard feature will be based on https://www.personalcapital.com/
as well as online retirement calculators.
